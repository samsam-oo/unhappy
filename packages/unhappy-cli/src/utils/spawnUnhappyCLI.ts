/**
 * Cross-platform Unhappy CLI spawning utility
 * 
 * ## Background
 * 
 * We built a command-line JavaScript program with the entrypoint at `dist/index.mjs`.
 * This needs to be run with `node`, but we want to hide deprecation warnings and other 
 * noise from end users by passing specific flags: `--no-warnings --no-deprecation`.
 * 
 * Users don't care about these technical details - they just want a clean experience
 * with no warning output when using Unhappy.
 * 
 * ## The Wrapper Strategy
 * 
 * We created a wrapper script `bin/unhappy.mjs` with a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node`.
 * This allows direct execution on Unix systems and NPM automatically generates 
 * Windows-specific wrapper scripts (`unhappy.cmd` and `unhappy.ps1`) when it sees 
 * the `bin` field in package.json pointing to a JavaScript file with a shebang.
 * 
 * The wrapper script either directly execs `dist/index.mjs` with the flags we want,
 * or imports it directly if Node.js already has the right flags.
 * 
 * ## Execution Chains
 * 
 * **Unix/Linux/macOS:**
 * 1. User runs `unhappy` command
 * 2. Shell directly executes `bin/unhappy.mjs` (shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env node`)
 * 3. `bin/unhappy.mjs` either execs `node --no-warnings --no-deprecation dist/index.mjs` or imports `dist/index.mjs` directly
 * 
 * **Windows:**
 * 1. User runs `unhappy` command  
 * 2. NPM wrapper (`unhappy.cmd`) calls `node bin/unhappy.mjs`
 * 3. `bin/unhappy.mjs` either execs `node --no-warnings --no-deprecation dist/index.mjs` or imports `dist/index.mjs` directly
 * 
 * ## The Spawning Problem
 * 
 * When our code needs to spawn Unhappy cli as a subprocess (for daemon processes), 
 * we were trying to execute `bin/unhappy.mjs` directly. This fails on Windows 
 * because Windows doesn't understand shebangs - you get an `EFTYPE` error.
 * 
 * ## The Solution
 * 
 * Since we know exactly what needs to happen (run `dist/index.mjs` with specific 
 * Node.js flags), we can bypass all the wrapper layers and do it directly:
 * 
 * `spawn('node', ['--no-warnings', '--no-deprecation', 'dist/index.mjs', ...args])`
 * 
 * This works on all platforms and achieves the same result without any of the 
 * middleman steps that were providing workarounds for Windows vs Linux differences.
